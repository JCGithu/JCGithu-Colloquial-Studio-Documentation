title: Using Stream Tools
description: Start here
---

If you're already sorted with streaming on a desktop via OBS then adding stream tools is extremely simple.

Once opening up any stream tool there will be a setting to the side to input your Twitch channel name. This is how it links to your chat.

:::note
This does not require logging in. You can use any tool on any Twitch channel - why not test how it looks!
:::

Once you reload the app (via the refresh icon in the channel input box) then you'll see a live preview of the app on the right hand side.

From here customise all the settings you want.

When you're done copy the URL in the top bar of the dashboard. Then in OBS include this URL as a browser source. The look of the app is very dependant on the height and width you set the browser within OBS, so please bear that in mind while styling.
