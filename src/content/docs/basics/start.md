If you're already sorted with streaming on a desktop via OBS then adding stream tools is extremely simple.

Once opening up any stream tool there will be a setting on the left panel to input your Twitch channel name.

:::note
This <ins>does not</ins> require logging in.

Once you reload the app _(via the refresh icon in the channel input box)_ you'll see a live preview of the app on the right hand side.

Now - customise all the settings you want.

When you're done, copy the URL in the top bar of the dashboard. In OBS include this URL as a `Browser Source`.

:::caution
The look of the app is very dependant on the height and width you set the browser within OBS.
