Each tool has 3 save slots. You can save and load these via the settings menu, to the left of the URL bar. This is for keeping different presets, for example seperate styles for your intro screen or BRB.

### But, my saves are gone?!

This site does not require <ins>logging in</ins> or <ins>saving of any of your data</ins> -- to make it as easy as possible to pick up and try.

One downside of this is that the saves are tied **to your browser**. Saving in Chrome will not appear in Firefox, or in Chrome on a different device.

:::tip
You can import the URLs you use in OBS into stream tools via the same settings menu. This allows you to easily share or keep settings for future use.
