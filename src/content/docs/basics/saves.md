Each tool has 3 save slots. You can save and load these via the settings menu, right next to the URL bar.

This is for keeping different presets, such as a different styled chat for your intro screen and main stream.

### But, my saves are gone?!

I was very commited to making sure that this site does not require logging in or saving of any of your data - just to make it as easy to pick up and use as possible.

One downside of this is that the saves are only tied to your browser. So if you save something in Chrome on your laptop it will not appear in Firefox, or in Chrome on mobile.
