## The Layout

Here's the main structure of Chatter. This can all be pulled from inspecting the app, but this is a bit easier, right?

```html
<section>
  <!-- This is the entire app -->
  <div id="chatBoundary">
    <div id="chatBubble">
      <!-- For each message -->
      <div id="chatContent">
        <span>
          <b class="chatName"></b>
          <span class="pronoun"></span>
          <span class="divider"></span>
          <!-- For each word of message -->
          <span class="word"> </span>
          <!-- For each emote of message -->
          <img class="emote" />
        </span>
      </div>
    </div>
    <!-- Underlying background -->
    <div id="chatBackground"></div>
  </div>
</section>
```

## Notable Sections

### Chat Boundary <sup><sub> _`id:chatBoundary`_</sub></sup>

This contains the whole app, so used for broad changes.

{" "}

<Card title="CSS Variables" icon="pen">
  `--padding` `--fontSize`
</Card>

### Chat Bubble <sup><sub>_`class:chatBubble`_</sub></sup>

Each chat message comes through as a bubble. Specific CSS variables related to the user that has sent the message will be applied to each bubble, which you could overwrite. See more about that in the [next section](/chatter/css)

Text flow and wrapping is annoyingly tricky in CSS, so beware that any changes could mess up multi-line chat messages.

`animHeight` is needed for animations, so would not recommend applying anything to that unless you are specifically writing custom animations.

<Card title="CSS Variables" icon="pen">
  `--animTime` `--animEase` `--userCol` `--shadowCol` `--animHeight`
</Card>

### Divider <sup><sub>_`class:divider`_</sub></sup>

The divider symbol between user and message, `:` by default. To change, target the `:before` psudeo-element and change the `content` CSS value.

### chatBackground <sup><sub>_`id:chatBackground`_</sub></sup>

Very self-explanitory. Does not contain any chat data.

Could be replaced with images, gradients, or other custom designs.

  `--bgColour`
</Card>
